\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
This survey has reviewed recent works related to weakly hard constraints with an emphasis on its application to control systems. Various methods to compute and verify weakly-hard guarantees are studied. We focus on weakly hard model's applications to distributed embedded control systems such that the security and robustness of the systems are enhanced. We also study MIP formulation, an optimization technique common in the community of real-time systems. Lastly, we propose a new approach to leverage the weakly hard model to enhance the robustness of distributed embedded control systems in automatic vehicles.
